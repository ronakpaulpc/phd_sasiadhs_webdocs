This is the Quarto website for documentation of harmonization, pooling and analysis of South Asian Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) datasets. This is a part of my PHD research on **"Clustering and Risk Factors of Fetal Deaths and Early-life Mortality and Across Families and Communities in South Asian Countries"** under Dr Abhishek Singh and Dr Domantas Jasilionis. In South Asia, DHS datasets are available for the following 6 countries:

1.  Afghanistan

2.  Bangladesh

3.  India

4.  Maldives

5.  Nepal

6.  Pakistan

The contents of this website are distributed into the following sections:

-   **Raw Data Dictionaries:** This section contains the dictionaries of the variables available across the birth history, individual, household and person recode files of South Asian DHS.

-   **Variable checklist:** This section contains the checklist of the variables we need for analysis across the DHS datasets of South Asia.

-   **Data Pooling Pre-checks:** Here we have documented the variable structures before harmonizing and pooling.

-   **Pooled Data Dictionaries:** This section contains the data dictionaries of the pooled datasets to be used for analysis across South Asia and it's countries.

-   **Preliminary Data Analysis:** In this section we perform basic data analysis to get an idea about the trends and determinants of early-life mortality clustering.
