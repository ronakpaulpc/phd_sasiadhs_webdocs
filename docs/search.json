This is a part of my PHD research on “Clustering and Risk Factors of Fetal Deaths and Early-life Mortality and Across Families and Communities in South Asian Countries” under Dr Abhishek Singh and Dr Domantas Jasilionis. In South Asia, DHS datasets are available for the following 6 countries:\n\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nIndia\nMaldives\nNepal\nPakistan\n\nThe contents of this website are distributed into the following sections:\n\nRaw Data Dictionaries: This section contains the dictionaries of the variables available across the birth history, individual, household and person recode files of South Asian DHS.\nData Pooling Pre-checks: Here we have documented the variable structures before harmonizing and pooling.\nPreliminary Data Analysis: In this section we perform basic data analysis to get an idea about the trends and determinants of early-life mortality clustering.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit https://quarto.org/docs/websites.
